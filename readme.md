Junting

# Business Major
This is Junting Chen, a sophomore in University of Rochester, and I prefer Christy as my English name. I am major in Business and consider minoring in or BA computer science. Therefore, I took CSC 170 last semester for the foundation of CSC 174 this semester. Exploring opportunities during college life is my first goal, including life decisions, career path, and networking.


Jialin

# Business Major
As a fifth-year student at the University of Rochester, I am double majoring in Business Finance and Art History, with a minor in Computer Science. Due to computer science and codingï¿½s popularity and its extensive use in all kinds of fields and the business world, I have decided to re-classify from Class of 2019 to Class of 2020 in order to complete this challenging but extremely useful minor and coding abilities. Until now, I have acquired coding experience including Python, R Studio, HTML, CSS and little knowledge of JavaScript Plugins and I am thrilled to learn more from both my professors and classmates.
