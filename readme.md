# CS Major
Richard Owusu Akomea was born on April 11, 1997, in Tarkwa, Ghana. He is majoring in Computer Science at University of Rochester. His father, Richard Kofi Akomea, is a Reverend Pastor and a practising Pentecostal from Amuanna Praso, Tano, and worked as a Farmer, working at the ministry of Forestry in his early career.Richard's mother, Joyce Arko Akomea, is an Akan from Akyim who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Richard held a sermon at Church of Pentecost- Koforidua, where he first interacted with Joyce, who was in attendance. He is a citizen of Ghana. In his youth, Richard attended a Catholic day school, and formally celebrated becoming a kindergarten graduate in a religious service.

# Hobby
As a child, Richard played for amateur team Young Kotoko from 2011 to 2012, in Ardoggon ,Spintex Road, and later spent a couple of months with Sweps FC . In 2014, aged 17, he went on a three-day trial with Sweps FC senior team, but didn't make the final cut for the 23 man team. He subsequently moved from Accra to Gbawe, where he joined the Gbawe DC school Local pick up team. By age 10, Richard believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and tried to convince his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on soccer. While popular with other students at school, he known rather for his academic achievements than his soccer playing skills or football as it is called in Ghana and everywhere else in the world. However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a right knee contusion, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing soccer.

Richard began his early production career in the mid-2010s, creating beats primarily for himself, an upcoming local artist, eventually developing a style that involved a combination of styles amany famous artists. His first official song came at the age of eighteen when he produced and rapped on YOLO, a single he put out in 2015 with Tony Dickson. For a while now, Richard has not released any musical projects but has appeared on other albums such as Jamal Damiens recital released on soundcloud. Richard also has a history of organising musical concerts with the 2015 Singspiration being evidence of that.

This is Junting Chen, a sophomore in University of Rochester, and I prefer Christy as my English name. I am major in Business and consider minoring in or BA computer science. Therefore, I took CSC 170 last semester for the foundation of CSC 174 this semester. Exploring opportunities during college life is my first goal, including life decisions, career path, and networking.

During the college time, I participate in the local Chinese Ensemble, we had lots of performances during each year, especially during the Chinese traditional festival. We have both ensemble and solo performance. I am also taking dancing and painting activities in my school to enrich my life. I persistent on my hobbies since high school time, and always being open-minded with any other new chances.

The entire internship lasts about one month, and I worked in Urban Planning Division and followed “Xiaomeisha” project, doing preliminary research, engaging every conference and composing lots of related materials. Since the first day of working, me and my colleagues spared all effort, devoted us in this project. Starting with the preliminary research, I have done the investigation of three collaborative companies, including company information, core staffs and specialists information and other references or sources. Furthermore, me and my colleagues engaged in many meetings to discuss “Xiaomeisha”, as it has special marine need and distinct developing plans. I also participated a training conference about Beijing “Hutong” style architecture with the study of Beijing Nanluoguxiang done. In the conference, we share thoughts to exemplify how to decentralize the tourists to different but nearby areas and how to complete the transformation of relics or old buildings. I have assisted with some supplementary work, such as conference translation, extended research, and document-composing. Additionally, I took in part with client-side negotiating and assistance for some new projects that come to AECOM.

Jialin

# Business Major
As a fifth-year student at the University of Rochester, I am double majoring in Business Finance and Art History, with a minor in Computer Science. Due to computer science and coding’s popularity and its extensive use in all kinds of fields and the business world, I have decided to re-classify from Class of 2019 to Class of 2020 in order to complete this challenging but extremely useful minor and coding abilities. Until now, I have acquired coding experience including Python, R Studio, HTML, CSS and little knowledge of JavaScript Plugins and I am thrilled to learn more from both my professors and classmates.

Outside of school works and internships, I spend my free time with my hobbies and moreover exploring my possibilities in different kinds of areas, including sports and music. I am particularly interested in playing tennis, swimming, skiing, and golf. During other times, I have dedicated my energy to philanthropy and charity activities in which I consider them significant and memorable. For six years, I have gone to Seattle annually and served as a volunteer to plan and hold fundraisers in order to help with the education of vision-impaired children; and the program has helped over fifty students to progress from elementary school through college.
